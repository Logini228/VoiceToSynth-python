I want you to take vocal.wav and vocal2.wav and combine their pitches 

Input:
 - vocal.wav
 - vocal2.wav
 - int (percentages, 50 means 50/50 of pitches of both audio files, 75 means 75/25, 25 means 25/75 and so on)

Output:
 - combined_pitch.json

How: Both audio files have pitch because they are sung. I want you to extract pitches from both audios, normalize the lower pitch one to the higher pitch one, and then combine them in specified rate.

Result: a .json file containing pitch for each milisecond of audio.

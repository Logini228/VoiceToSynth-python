I want you to take vocal.wav and turn it in the way so you reconstruct it using the sounds from specified folder. There will be 2 folders for now: for synthv and for vocaloid. The script should look ONLY the sound files from the specified folder. the sound files naming is language-sound-duration.wav (for example: spanish-la-half.wav)(in use half for 0.5, quarter for 0.25 and eigth for 0.125). Make sure to analyze well the soundwave and pick the right sound with the right duration

Input:
 - vocal.wav
 - String (specify SynthV or Vocaloid)

Output:
 - reconstructed.wav
 - reconstructed.json

How: the vocal.wav is my singing that I want to reconstruct using all the sounds

Result: A .wav file at least 80% identical to vocal.wav and a json version of which sounds and when

Json file structure example:
"1":
	"starttime":"00:00:00",
	"endtime":"00:01:00",
	"language":"Spanish",
	"sound":"la",
	"duration":"0.5"

(that was sound la of 0.5 beat in spanish from second 0 to second 1)

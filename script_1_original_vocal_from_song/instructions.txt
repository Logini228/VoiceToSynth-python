I want you to take song.wav and instr.wav and invert them in the way so the song.wav without instrumental pure vocal

Input:
 - song.wav
 - instr.wav

Output:
 - vocal.wav

How: song is just a combination of vocal and instrument so getting the exact song and instrument should be enough to get vocals. In other words, using song and instr isolate vocals.

Result: A .wav file at least 95% identical to vocal.wav . DO NOT USE vocal.wav IN THE CODE, it is here just for check result

ALL SCRIPTS ONLY USE PYTHON. 
All scripts should be able to be called to be called from command line with specified inputs and create specified outputs.

Json file structure example:
"1":
	"starttime":"00:00:00",
	"endtime":"00:01:00",
	"language":"Spanish",
	"sound":"la",
	"duration":"0.5"

(that was sound la of 0.5 beat in spanish from second 0 to second 1)

The code should not have many comments but be very self-documented. Create 2 scripts at a time, one for utility fuctions and another one for main workflow so it stays clean.

After the code was successfully implemented and tested, optimize the code and test again.

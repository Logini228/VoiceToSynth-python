I want you to take vocal.wav and turn it in the way so you get the piano file midi.mid of the audio

Input:
 - vocal.wav

Output:
 - midi.mid

How: the vocal.wav file was sung in the vocaloid software using a midi. I want you to write script that reverse-engineers the vocal to make a midi out of it

Result: A .mid file at least 95% identical to midi.mid . DO NOT USE midi.mid IN THE CODE, it is here just for check result
